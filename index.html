<p><strong><u>PART 1: MY Profile</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular</strong></p>
<p><strong>event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have always been interested in IT from a young age and due to the fact that I grew up in a generation that is was surrounded by modern consumer electronics the modern internet and modern social media and the cultural shift that came about with all of these things hitting the mainstream, it was about 5 or 6 when I started building PCS mainly just so I could play video games but as I grew up the power of I.T really started to awe and terrify me, tales like a deep learning A.I that can tell what products you want before you want or single man-made program that after being fed the right data and variables was able to perfectly predict the winners on the track at the Hong Kong horse racers. when it comes to experiences well I&rsquo;ve never had the opportunity to become formally trained until now therefore I am completely self-taught</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I chose RMIT Because I have a keen interest in broadening my horizons, from programming to hardware and most importantly since RMIT is one on the most prestigious universities when it comes to the field of I.T only with there studies of data studies witch will be very important as I wish to be employed in A.I research</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I expect to learn the basic skill used in a large variety of I.T professions such as programming languages such as C++ javascript and HTML 2 only with various hardware skills like basic PC maintenance up to maintaining and developing the policies and equipment used in a company setting such as Datacenter management along with the fundamentals of ethically and proper protocols for things such as privacy and security.</p>

<p>&nbsp;When it comes to job AI research will always be the end goal</p>
<p>A job like the one seen here where I work as a researcher in a top university with a un-attached from the whims of profit incentive of companies would allow me to focus on a large number of fields and disciplines in a consistently challenging workplace with likeminded people working toward technologies that will change that world as we know it</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When it comes to skills needed to work in this environment</p>
<p>Skills and qualifications are the ability to develop complex algorithms and understand data sets through training in data science and using software and programming in languages like C++ and Java to automate this complex algorithm along with some skills in engineering &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications, and experience you currently have</p>
<p>Sadly, I have no skills, qualifications, and experience in I.T apart from a minor experience building home computers</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When it comes to my plan to achieve this I plan to finish this bachelor in I.T and then complete my Master in data science then from there fill any gaps in my training with discussions of my peers and personally reading on the subject</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PT 3:Personality Test</p>
<p>for my personality tests in order I chose</p>
<p>&nbsp;a Myre-Briggs test hosted by 16personalites.com</p>
<p>&nbsp;a learning style test hosted by educattionplanner.com</p>
<p>a Big Five test hosted by truitly.com &nbsp;</p>

<p>When it comes to what these test results mean to honestly I don&rsquo;t believe they hold much weight due to the many variables that affect a person&rsquo;s personality along with the fact that the answer&rsquo;s come from the self which is internally untrustworthy as people tend to project the best or worst of themselves when doing such tests and the other issue is that not to factor in mental illness and only really works for a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; person</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When it comes to how these may affect my ability to work in a group as stated before I don&rsquo;t really see these tests having any on the practical world and I believe myself to be flexible enough to fit into any group dynamic</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When it comes to taking this into account when forming a team, I tend to focus on the other people and make sure they make a good team and then I can fill any gaps left within the group</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Project</p>
<p>My project is simple with no real innovation but just for the fun factor the idea is to build a self-learning that is able to control the classic 1993 video game DOOM the goal will be simple in theory, reach the end of the level without dying how the A.I manages to complete this task will be completely up how the algorithm evolves</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When it comes to motivation the main reason is mainly for just the fun and challenge and the fact that making such a thing wouldn&rsquo;t require any expensive components &nbsp;but also I believe it could serve as a great form of entertainment watching the deep learning AI in real-time run by run as it learns and evolves along with it serving a great learning tool to help explain the more complex ideas and base mechanics of deep learning AI and how they learn and operate in such an environment</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When it comes to the description the first thing will be setting up a self-learning ai ill most likely start with dooms basic ai and modify it for terrain and enemy recognition and using Q learning model which in its most basic form assigns positive and negative &ldquo;points&rdquo; to certain actions like reward system and through trial and error the ai will learn how to plan to acquire the most amount of points in both the short and long term What elements and assets will be assigned point values may take some trial and error as I am not internally sure on which variables will get the best results but assigning points to killing enemies and simply traversing the level and maybe to picking up items depending how hard building in the ability for the recognize item pickups as weighting points to them could be a massive boon to the speed of development and to stop the ai from hitting dead ends and plateau and with that and an exploration value that allows the ai to make random choices will help explore the environment by the time this experiment is complete the ai should be able to derive its own TD policy which if done correctly the ai should be mostly able to navigate the environment in Doom it has never seen before due the fact it was made with a model free learning principle &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When it comes to tools and technologies there no real new technologies ill be using just a coding language most likely phyton as it seems easy to learn and program with that emulating doom would be useful as I could use it to easily allow me to integrate the controls of the game with handing that ai any real control over my pc actual inputs (mouse and keyboard and such) and my home pc should more than powerful to calculate and run the many processes</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When it comes to skills to learn well everything first will be learning a programming language python c++ or javascript are all good options all probably python will be my most likely pick due to how easy it is to learn and he vastness of learning resources when it comes to data science and mathematics ill have to completely self-teach myself and of course learn a lot of the skills during this course</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When it comes to the outcome of the experiment, if successful I don&rsquo;t imagine I will change much in the world but it would serve as a great introduction to the complex world of model-free AI design and ill hope it will serve as a way to people who only I have a vague idea of what modern-day AI looks and acts like and of course I hope it would help inspire people to be as interested in the field as I am</p>
